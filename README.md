## What is it?
[Daily Coding Problem](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/) is a service that emails programming problems used in interviews by actual companies! These are my own solutions for the problems they send out.

I've been writing these in Python because it's a language I want to brush up on. Plus, it's one of the easier ones to haphazardly throw something together (in my opinion).

## Are the solutions good?
I wouldn't bank on it.

## Is it good practice?
You betcha!

## Why are you posting this online?
Why does anything post anything online? Brain chemicals, that's why.
